This directory contains a working example for using vmgen.  It's a
small Modula-2-like programming language.

You can build the example by first installing Gforth and then saying,
in this directory:

make

Ignore the warnings.  You can check that it works with

make check

You can run afvm programs like this:

./afvm fib.afvm

To learn about the options, type
