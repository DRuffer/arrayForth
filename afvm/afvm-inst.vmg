\  The stack is organized as follows:
\  The stack grows downwards; a stack usually looks like this:

\  higher addresses
\  --------------------- bottom of stack
\     locals of main
\     return address (points to VM code after call)
\  +->oldfp (NULL)
\  |  intermediate results (e.g., 1 for a call like 1+foo(...))
\  |  arguments passed to the called function
\  |  locals of the called function
\  |  return address (points to VM code after call)
\  +--oldfp                <-- fp
\     intermediate results <-- sp
\  ---------------------- top of stack
\  lower addresses

\ The following VM instructions also explicitly reference sp and
\ therefore may have to do something about spTOS caching.

call ( #target #iadjust -- targetret aoldfp )
/* IF_spTOS(sp[2] = spTOS);*/ /* unnecessary; vmgen inserts a flush anyway */
targetret = IP;
SET_IP(target);
aoldfp = fp;
sp = (Cell *)(((char *)sp)+iadjust);
fp = (char *)sp;
/* IF_spTOS(spTOS = sp[0]); */ /* dead, thus unnecessary; vmgen copies aoldfp there */

return ( #iadjust target afp i1 -- i2 )
/* IF_spTOS(sp[-2] = spTOS); */ /* unnecessary; that stack item is dead */
SET_IP(target);
sp = (Cell *)(((char *)sp)+iadjust);
fp = afp;
i2=i1;
/* IF_spTOS(spTOS = sp[0]); */ /* dead, thus unnecessary; vmgen copies i2 there */

\ loadlocal and storelocal access stack items below spTOS, so we can
\ ignore spTOS caching.

loadlocal ( #ioffset -- i )
i = *(Cell *)(fp+ioffset);

storelocal ( #ioffset i -- )
*(Cell *)(fp+ioffset) = i;

end ( i -- )
