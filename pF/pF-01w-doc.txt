Changes to make polyFORTH/G144-01w
Based upon pF/G144-01v
With full history before that.
==========================================

VIRTUAL MACHINE TO DO:

- Why does reclaim in 718 give bad grey word in 740?
- Parameterize inverted RS232 output in 732.
- Change John's keyboard buffer operation.
- Try reducing from 10 to 6 nodes for UART.

uCODE opportunities
- ?DUP in stack node, put at 20:
     : 'qdup  if
     : 'dup   dup pshw ;
     ...
     : 'nop   then then ;
- U<
- Multiply/divide
- Better /ba
- Variable shift or by 8 or unsighed right shift
- 2/MOD, byte ops argh
- @+ !+ ?
- next
- ND! (OVER SWAP !)


polyFORTH SYSTEM TO DO:

- Make ['] explicitly NOT search IMMEDIATE words!?
- Timeout on disk ops
- Recode U< to use UM+  ( NEGATE UM+ SWAP DROP 0=)
- Start on test runner
- What is "remote" bit 4000 in a head? (DESCEND)
- Refactor / remove args to INTERPRET
- Add UNDO.
- Silent disk error pass-thru

==========================================

MAJOR THINGS DONE / TO DOCUMENT:

arrayForth/colorForth:

- literal  is now usable while audit loaded.
- ?ram and ?rom in IDE no longer clobber a in target node.

VIRTUAL MACHINE:

- Shortened poll latency in node 107 for SRAM services
- Made idle response time deterministic
- Shortened cycle lengths on reads and writes in node 007.
- Redefined VM instruction set for optimal use of the four
  adjacent coprocessor nodes.  Still not actually used, but
  will be in 1c and that must happen almost instantly.
- The primitives that had to be moved from bitsy and stack
  nodes have been relocated to node 006.
- Updated arrayForth with 3.5f changes.
- Updated arrayForth with latest DC and ATS tests.
- Reorganized code in 700ff as first step of
  VM build cleanup.
- Reorganized serial IDE load block and other mech to
  facilitate factoring of customizations.  Re-did the
  700 structure to be dead minimal, use same mechanism
  in ATS structures.
- Added & tested sync boot master for node 300, and
  UUT was able to process a boot frame.
- Added & tested sync bridge for both chips node 300.
- Added & tested SRAM interface support for masking masters
  and interchanging stimuli.
- IDE booting procedure revamped completely to eliminate
  fragility and enable loading whole chip.
- Mastering I/O null pointers now zero vice -1.

polyFORTH SYSTEM:

- Faithful to memory model done for Novix.
- Nucleus, 9 LOAD, Target Compiler and Testing utility complete.
- 4 char typeahead in serial input
- Caveat re typeahead on services & ^D to unlock
- Serial input buffer problems are with drivers for Prolific
  and ATEN units.  Use FTDI on Windows boxes.
- Made 960kbit terminal usable for disk.
- Charley's SPI flash boot installed and working for pF
- Mem management pointer structures simplified.  MMPTR is now
  double addresses and is found directly in low memory.
- Snorkel and Ganglia now supported for memory master I/O.
- SST25WFxxx SPI Flash disk now supported.

ATS 

- Tested TB001 master hardware and programmed the
  pretest for opens and shorts on UUT power buses.
- Added mechanism to run boot streams into UUT sync
  node.
- Added all the tests we used on 1 July (see ATS history)
- Fixed notorious  load?  problem and probably the other
  secondary anomalies.
- Added more tests and converted one of Steven's crawlers.
- Fixed assumption of b=io (current boot streams garbage B
  on the way thru uninvolved nodes.)

*29 - GB Version.  GB Move SYSTEM screen here.

48 - GB Enlarge nucleus in TESTING:  RAM sized for 9 blocks, SUCK and INSTALL 9 blocks, WHAM 4608 words.  Put  'reload @EXECUTE  in  WHAM to turn masters off.

50 - GB Enlarge target comparison to 4608 words (9 blocks).

53 - GB Say EVB001.  Add words left report.

54 - GB Enlarge RAM to 4608 and erase all of it.  Wrap at 4608 in >T.  Save 9 blocks in FLUSH.

=============================
CHANGES TO ARRAYFORTH for 01w, for FINAL 01e generation
(against 01d1):
=============================

210 - CS Added variable "root" to help avoid visiting the root node if it happens to be at the end of the path. In "ship" the active node, which is the root node at this point, is stored into "root" and the path is incremented. Commented "pause" has been moved to "deliver" in 214. Also hooking of the active path has been moved into "deliver", on 214.

214 - CS "route" now leaves the root node as active, so that "ship" can copy it into "root". "deliver" now does the hooking, factoring it out of "body". A commented "pause" has been moved here for the same reason, factoring.

240 - CS In "frame" removed the test for visiting the root node and inserted "exec" as the parameter to "head". Now we always visit the root node and there's no decision to be made concerning the concatenation address.

452 - CS Removed extra node 10 from custom IDE path as a result of changes in 210 to allow visiting last node in list.

466 - CS Removed the "exec" and "warm" parameters before "frame". A result of the changes in 240.

846 - CS Template for loader. (Where does it actually belong?)

848 - CS Template for flamer and flash burner. (Where does it actually belong?)

1080 - CS Now using "sram load" to load module by name.

1140 - CS Using "host load" instead of "serial load".

1162 - CS Now using bin number instead of node numbers to load ram and mask changed from xa00 to x8a00.

1174 - CS Specs for 705 and 108 have been moved here, the whole flash to sram bunch.

1180 - CS Removed the "exec" and "warm" parameters before "frame". Replaced "path" with "entire course". Removed second "/root" since "frame" now takes care of that detail. Added "708 +node xaa /p" as in the polyFORTH version to keep 708 bootable for IDE just in case.

1182 - CS Changed "node" to "+node" and "boot" to "/part".

1190 - CS Added feedback, length of eforth image.

1194 - CS Added feedback, length of boot stream.



=============================

416 - CS Add temp example of IDE boot.

434 - CS Removed "panel upd". There was no "pause" anyway so it was invisible, and it would hang when the hooked node stopped listening.

450 - CS Added stream length display to feedback.

454 - CS Node 208 has become just another wire node here. Bin 1712 is no longer used. Also moved specifications for nodes 108 and 705 here. Those are the endpoints of the sram loader.

464 - CS Added "0 /p" to start up node 108, which is now the sram loader. Simplified specifications by eliminating "/root" for node 705 and moving the sram loader endpoints to 454. Removed a redundant use of "path".

474 - CS Added stream length display to feedback.

CHANGES TO ARRAYFORTH for 01v2 (01c)
(against 01v+ as in 01b aF release):
- Finish deprecating cased comments.
- Add softsim interactive capability
- New functions onamed and bnamed to override default
  .cf filenames. (4.2a kernel required)
- Softsim now has known state after boot.
- Update SPI testbed
- Code to write stream as a file
- Fix softsim handling of extended arith mode
- Add softsim display of carry latch
- forths and macros now have heads (4.2a kernel required)
- Add IDE baud rate & framing settings (4.2a kernel required)
- Update native IDE for current systems and hardware conventions
=============================

18* - Version.

34 - GB Change native  serial  to be 108 .

36 - GB Change windows  serial  to be 112 .

46 - GB Remove kludge defns of forths & macros .

66 - GB De-implement obsolete tags 10 and 11 (cased comments) by removing from editor hint map and nullifying behaviors.  Change the hint for white to w.

74 - GB Remove old example, update shadow.  Add onamed and bnamed for filename override.

108..114 - GB Move blocks 110..116 down one to make room for com port management code.

108 - GB Adjust block number 112 to be 110

110 - GB Add dummy  !nam sport bps  for native IDE compatibility.  Reverse modem control register values 2,0 -> 0,2 for correct polarity of RTS used as reset.  Add a 1 bit to each so that DTR is high to power minimal RS232 interfaces.  Enlarge sdat from 16384 to 24576 for larger and multiple chips.

112 - GB Load 3 blocks starting at 114 for windows serial

114 - GB Remove +ser -ser ctl! and reset.

116 - GB Strip down to just +ser -ser ctl! and reset.  Add code for manipulating COM port DCBs.  Add variable  bps .  Have  +ser  set baud rate & framing using  bps  for rate, defaulted to 115.2

148 - CS Added 1242 load at top to make a boot demo stream. SPI flash testbed in now compiled starting at block 1244 and an interactive vocabulary is compiled starting at 1238.  CS Removed some comments. Commented out bootstream and SPI testbed. Move definition of /softsim lower so it can include "default", defined in block 1240.

202 - GB Add a-bps and c-bps config parameters.

206 - GB Set a-bps in bps for host.

208 - GB Set c-bps in bps for target.

250 - GB Set a-bps in bps for flash erase function.

252 - GB Set a-bps in bps for flash writer 18-bit.

258 - GB Set a-bps in bps for flash writer 8 bit.

282 - CS Added definition for "file", namely block 294.

294 - CS Stream to file. Opens a file named stream.bin and writes the bootstream out as a binary file.

420 - GB Set a-bps in bps for pF IDE boot.

660 - GB Set a-bps in bps for TB001 IDE pretest.

670 - GB Set a-bps in bps for TB001 IDE creepers.

708 - GB Set a-bps in bps for selftest, note a-bps is assumed!

712 - GB Set a-bps in bps for autotest, note a-bps is assumed!

844 - GB Set a-bps in bps for demo ide boot.

1140 - GB Set a-bps in bps for eforth IDE boot

1238, 40 - CS Interactive vocabulary added to softsim.  CS Added "default" to set softsim display to a known initial state the first time you run softsim after a warm (or cold) boot.

1242 - CS A boot stream is built for use as an example in softsim. It's the smtm compiled into node 0.

1244 - CS SPI flash testbed points to where bootstreams are now built.

1266 CS - Changed mask in "access" from x1ff to x3ff to allow having P9 set to enable add with carry. This was preventing add with carry from being executed in softsim.

1268 - CS Added "?+*c" in order to properly add the carry in +* when P9 is set. Changed mask in ++abus from x7f to x37f so incrementing the address bus doesn't change P9 (or P8 for that matter).

1272 - CS Added "18bit" to +*.

1282 - CS Display of T changed to show state of carry bit to left of T as a . if set, nothing if clear.

1284 - CS Added a couple of "x1ff and" so that the softsim display will colorize the memory dump properly when P9 is set.  CS - Removed "1ff and" twice. Changed "40 - and" to "240 - and" and "100 - and" to "900 - and". All this allows the memory dump to color the IP and PC addresses correctly even when P9 is set for add with carry.

=============================

CHANGES TO ARRAYFORTH for 01o
(against 01n):
=============================

18* - Version.  GB Cleanup, keep documentation in shadows, add loading of tools.

116 - GB Restore default sport to 1 or 10.

152 - GB Document additional steps needed in redaction.

190 - GB Enlarge  nnc  to 3 chips' worth

200 - CS Removed "sram" and "resume" magic numbers.

202 - GB Add ga app tools load block with definitions for a-com, c-com, host and target.

204 - GB Add user app tools load block

206 - GB Add serial IDE wrapper for EVB001 host.

208 - GB Add serial IDE wrapper for EVB001 target.

278 - GB Select dumb instead of maxim for EVB001.

286 - CS Loop no longer uses "magic" number to load sram. Instead uses the length of file incoded in first word.

290 - CS Wire nodes also get word count in first word of "file".

292 - CS The magic number "resume" has been removed, replaced by a variable kept in the first word before the boot stream buffer. Two passes are needed to ensure that the address to "resume" the boot is correct. Also the loop counter is now the first word of the "file".  CS Mask off large number to avoid truncation traps in */ .

300 - GB Set pF IDE boot to use a-com for sport.

330 - CS The stream is built now at block 344, so that we can easily make two passes here to get the "resume" address right.

344 - CS Some speculative code has been moved to block 346, replaced here by the polyFORTH stream builder so that it can easily be done in two passes.

346 - CS Prospective code from 344 moved here.

354 - CS Now specific to polyFORTH nucleus. Reads the file into a buffer and passes the source, destination, and length on to the generic flash byte writer.

356 - CS "fbuf", the file buffer, is now in high memory shared with the stream buffer so it will survive an empty.

660 - GB Set TB001 IDE pretest to use a-com for sport.

670 - GB Set TB001 IDE creeper runner to use a-com for sport.

706 - GB Set selftest creeper runner to use a-com for sport.

1200 - CS "frame" no longer keeps the word count on the stack while building a stream. This can be calculated from the current position in the stream and the starting position in the stream, which are known.

1202 - CS Confusingly commented out numbers removed.

1204 - CS Added "stream" and "strlen". "stream" returns the base address of the stream buffer and it's word count. "strlen" returns just the words count. Room is left at the beginning of the stream to remember where the "resume" point is, after copying flash to sram.

1208 - CS "adjust" now uses "strlen" to pad the stream up to an 8 byte boundary instead of using a count on the stack. "/root" doesn't return a count anymore, relies on "strlen" instead.

1212 - CS Instead of the variable "addr" for source, now we use "source" and "dest" along with "len" when writing 18 bit words into flash.  GB Set boot flash writer to use a-com for sport.

1214 - CS IDE code for writing 18 bit words into flash now accepts "source dest len" as parameters. The "source" is an 18 bit word address in the stream buffer. "dest" is a byte address in the flash. "len" is an 18 bit word count. "read" has been changed to allow starting at any 20 bit byte address.

1216 - CS "reading" takes address low and high as parameters instead of assuming an application specific address.

1218 - CS The generic 8 bit flash writer now has variables called "source", "dest", and "len" and these parameters are passed when this block is loaded. The variables are used by the IDE code to erase, burn, and check the right area. The nucleus is read into a buffer before this block is loaded now.    GB Set nucleus burner to use a-com for sport.

1220 - CS The IDE code for erasing, burning, and checking flash in 8 bit chunks has been generalized to use the variables "source", "dest", and "len" to address the right part of flash. The stack is cleaned up now after a burn or a check, except for the flag left by check. Added r18 in order to read 18 bit words as well as 16 bit words. The address passed to "read" is a 20 bit byte address.
